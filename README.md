Gebet’a – World’s Oldest Board Game
Gebet’a- “One of the earlist evidence of the game are fragments of a pottery board and several rock cuts found in Aksumite Ethiopia in Matara (now in Eritrea) and Yeha (in Ethiopia), which are dated by archaeologists to between the 6th and 7th century AD; the game may have been mentioned by Giyorgis of Segla in his 14th century Ge’ez text “Mysteries of Heaven and Earth”.

I am planning to implement the simplest version of the game. 

I have collected the relevant documents and I know how to play the game very early. I used to play since I was 12.
